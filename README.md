# gutFluorescence
This repository contains data from a series of experiments that took place during the month of December, 2006. I designed this exercise to acquire gut fluorescence time series of copepods as they were feeding. I repeated these experiments 3 times for each copepod in three different temperatures. Ultimately I hoped to collect data would prove  useful in building and parameterizing more realistic individual-based models of copepod foraging. 
Contents include:

                  1. An EXCEL spreadsheet <pmgsummaryGF0612.xls containing summary data of the experiment including
                      * data about individual copepods used in the experiment
                      * data on the food used for the experiments
                      * post-experiment calculations incl.
                        - fecal pellet production rate vs. temperature
                        - decay rate of pigment in the posterior midgut (PMG) vs. temperature
                        - calculation of gut throughput time for easier comparison with the existing litterature.
                  2. Gut fluorescence time series data in the form of .mat files.
                  3. A movie depicting one such experiment where time series of different gut compartment are related to 
                    the frame sequence.
